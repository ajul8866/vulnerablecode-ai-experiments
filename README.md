# vulnerablecode-ai-experiments

This repository contains experiments with AI-driven parsers for analyzing vulnerabilities, extracting package URLs (PURLs), and determining affected/fixed version ranges.

## Usage

All parsers can be accessed through the `VulnerabilityAgent` class, which provides a unified interface for extracting structured vulnerability data.

**Create an instance of the `VulnerabilityAgent`:**
```bash
instance = VulnerabilityAgent()
```

## Parsing a PackageURL

**Get the Package URL (PURL) from a summary**
```bash
purl = instance.get_purl_from_summary(summary) # Output: pkg:pypi/django-helpdesk
```
Ensure that the summary variable contains enough information to extract the PURL.

**Get affected and fixed version ranges**
```bash
version_ranges = instance.get_version_ranges(summary, purl.type)
```
This will return a tuple containing two lists:
- `affected_versions`: Versions affected by the vulnerability
- `fixed_versions`: Versions where the vulnerability has been fixed

Example output:
```bash
print(version_ranges)  # Output: ([affected_version_range], [fixed_version_range]])
```

## Parsing a CPE

**Get the Package URL (PURL) for the given cpe:**
```bash
cpe = "cpe:2.3:a:django-helpdesk_project:django-helpdesk:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"
pkg_type = "pypi"
purl = instance.get_purl_from_cpe(cpe, pkg_type)
print(purl)  # Output: pkg:pypi/django-helpdesk
```
Ensure the `cpe` variable contains the relevant information to extract the PURL.

## Parsing a Vulnerability

**Get the Severity for the given summary:**
```bash
summary = "..."
severity = instance.get_severity_from_summary(summary)
print(severity)  # low , medium, high , critical 
```
Ensure the summary variable contains enough information to determine the severity.

**Get the CWE for the given summary:**
```bash
summary = "Deserialization of untrusted data in Microsoft Office SharePoint allows an authorized attacker to execute code over a network."
cwes = instance.get_cwe_from_summary(summary)
print(cwes)  # Output: CWE-502
```
Ensure the summary variable contains enough information to extract the CWE list.

## Parsing CVSS

**Get CVSS vector and base score from a summary:**
```bash
summary = "..."
cvss = instance.get_cvss_from_summary(summary)
print(cvss.vector)        # CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
print(cvss.base_score)    # 7.5
print(cvss.severity_label)# high
```

If the summary already contains an explicit CVSS vector it is extracted directly
(regex) and the score is computed from it; otherwise the LLM infers the vector.

### LLM Configuration:

To setup your LLM model, configure the following environment variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-open-ai-api-key"
OPENAI_API_BASE="your-open-ai-api-base"
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="your-open-ai-api-model-name"
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=your-model-temperature # must be a float value between 0 and 1

# optionally, you can also set a seed to produce more reproducible outputs
OPENAI_MODEL_SEED=1223372036854775807
```

> **NOTE**: The following variables can be configured with the credentials of any OpenAI compatible API (OpenAI, Ollama, lm-studio, openrouter, etc).

The above values can either be set in your environment variables, or in a `.env` file at the root of this project. To create a `.env` file, simply clone the `.env.sample` file and update the values.
